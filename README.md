Tosh-e-Daan is a restaurant website. The website was created using HTML and CSS for the front-end design, providing a visually appealing and user-friendly interface. To facilitate the booking of bulk food orders, we implemented PHP to collect and manage user details efficiently. This project highlights our ability to integrate front-end and back-end technologies to deliver a seamless user experience for restaurant customers.
